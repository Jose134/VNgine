## Version 1.1:

- MathParser:\
  The math parser has been redesigned to allow for boolean logic, and probably, better consistency and reliability. We're now using javascript's eval function with a big-ass regular expression that previously evaluates if the given string is allowed to run or not. We're only missing support for the not (!) operator, hopefully this will be added in a future update.

- Visual improvements:
  - Added fade-in and fade-out animations for the dialog modal.

## Version 1.0:
- Initial release
